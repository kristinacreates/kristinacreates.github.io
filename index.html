									<p>Falcons are quick and precise. They soar free before landing on their prey. Strong , agile and light. Seems like a worthy candidate to represent the gaming laptop. Based on my photographs, I took to creating sketches and drawing renditions of my Falcon icon.

										</p>
										<p>It seemed to evolve from ink with many splotches to tightening up the logo.Lessening the details worked!  Thus, I simplified the Falcon but captured its curved claw and feathers.</p>

								<div class="intro color0">
									<h2 class="major"> In Conclusion</h2>
									<p>Designing the Falcon to encompass  the  "Soar Free" was a great challenge. I realized I focused on the details. When I stepped away and saw all the ink blotted curves, it took away from what the Falcon is. It was interesting how my design became stronger by removing the details so the eye focuses on the simple strong linesit conveys.
										 </p>

										 <p>Designing  a package to both look attractive and to also protect its contents come hand in hand. In the future. I plan to revise and expand on this Raptor laptop brand.</p>
